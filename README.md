### **// Description**
---


EventsPen is a "Popup" E-Commerce website capable of offering turn-key hosting, sales, and curatorial services for clients. The site was created as the capstone project for Epicodus in Wordpress using X-Theme with modifications made within PHP and CSS for Google Maps API integration and custom stylization, respectively. Current content represents a mock-up of the variety of ways which a client's information, services, products, and other collateral is capable of being presented.
