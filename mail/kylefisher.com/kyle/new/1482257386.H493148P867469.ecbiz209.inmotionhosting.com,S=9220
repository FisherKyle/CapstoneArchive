Hi Kyle!  =

  =

Here's an update on internships and what to expect over the coming weeks:  =

  =

**Rankings and Matchmaking:**  =

  =

-We have four companies listed in Epicenter that are planning to host inter=
ns in January. As soon as possible, log into Epicenter, and drag and drop t=
he companies on the internship page from first to last choice.  =

  =

\- Remember to use the notes section if there are special circumstances or
something else you feel I need to know (if it's remote and you don't own a
computer, etc).  =

  =

\- Rankings are a two way street, and the companies get just as much say as
you do in where everyone ends up. I'm sure you read very carefully how the
matchmaking process works in your internship agreement and know you may not
get your top pick. I don't have a great deal of discretion in matchmaking to
begin with, but I walk through matches with other people to minimize the
chance of human error and ensure as many people get as high on their
preference list as possible.  =

  =

**Interview Schedule:**  =

  =

-I have reached out to the participating companies to get their interview a=
vailability and hoped to get the interview schedule to you by the end of th=
is week. However, since our timeline is a bit longer for the holidays, and =
our class is small, it is possible companies may ask for more time and dela=
y the release of that schedule. Regardless, unless a company has a conflict=
, all **interviews will be held Tuesday January 3rd through Friday January =
6th. I am working under the assumption that students are available any time=
 during this period; if you have a time that does not work for you, please =
let me know before I send out interview schedules.**  =

  =

- Remember that companies often drop out/come on board outside of the sched=
ule. It's the nature of the tech industry. Companies have unexpected budget=
 problems or surprise projects, and it doesn't always happen on exactly our=
 time line. If this happens, I'll reach out to let you know and ask you to =
adjust your rankings accordingly.  =

  =

**Mock Interviews/Additional documents:**  =

-If you have not submitted or received a passing grade on your cover letter=
/LinkedIn reviews, please submit/resubmit as soon as possible. I won't be a=
ble to place you on the interview schedule with companies until all grades =
are passing.   =

  =

-Many of you have expressed an interest in having a second mock interview. =
If you're interested, you can schedule one here: <https://calendly.com/ambe=
rarnold/mockinterview>  =

  =

tl;dr:  =

-Submit rankings  =

-Keep schedule open 1/3-1/6 for interviews  =

-Keep working on and submit Cover Letter, LinkedIn, and GitHub asap.  =

  =

If you have any questions in regards to ranking companies or interview
assignments, let me know.  =

  =

Thanks!  =
