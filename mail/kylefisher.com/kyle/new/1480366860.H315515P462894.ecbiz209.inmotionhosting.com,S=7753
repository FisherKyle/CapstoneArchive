Hey Kyle,  =

  =

Next week, I will start your cover letter and LinkedIn profile reviews.  =

  =

If you missed class today, make sure you review [these
lessons](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search
/internship-process/linkedin-mock-interviews-and-cover-letters-classwork) in
preparation for our these reviews.  =

  =

**By next Monday December 5th, please submit (via Epicenter Internship clas=
s):**  =

  =

=E2=80=A2 A completed cover letter based off of one of the internship compa=
ny
descriptions listed in Epicenter (doesn't matter which, as you haven't had
your interviews assigned yet). The more complete of a cover letter you have,
the better feedback we'll be able to give. The cover letter template we work
on together can then be used to write future versions.  =

=E2=80=A2 A completed LinkedIn profile  =

=E2=80=A2 A completed Resume  =

=E2=80=A2 Highlights or comments with any questions/concerns you'd like to =
get
specific feedback on  =

[technical](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/internship-and-job-search
/preparing-for-job-interviews/technical-interviews) interview questions.  =

=E2=80=A2 Have some questions ready that you would ask a potential employer=

Lastly, if you haven't done so already, you'll need to sign the [student
internship agreement](https://www.hellosign.com/s/9fc606e2) before our
meeting. Let me know if you have any questions!  =
