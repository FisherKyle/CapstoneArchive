<p align=3D"left">Dear Business Professional,</p>
<p style=3D"MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><a name=3D"_GoBack"></a>Every company needs=
 to        sell its products and services in order to stay in business and =
be        profitable, many do and too many don&rsquo;t. The reason for this=
 seems elusive        but is in fact simple, they sell to customers who the=
y know need their        services or products and are willing to pay for th=
em. Seems simple enough        though 80% of all small business fail within=
 3 years. What makes this        difference, selling effectively!</p>

In his new book, Selling is Everything, G. F. Tanham shares        the key =
buying process we all take to purchase everything, be it a        personal =
or professional purchase. The way we all purchase is the same and        ha=
rdwired into our brains so we use it in all instances. This is simple to   =
     state in that selling is finding the key values that buyers are using =
to        purchase. Learning the process of how people buy has been the dif=
ference        between success and failure, but never understood, by most o=
rganizations        or sales people. In Selling is Everything, you will lea=
rn the decision to        buy process we all use when buying and use it to =
be more effective,        successful and reach your sales goal in less time=
